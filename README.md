# clemson-parking-tracker-UI
A web app to visualize the current capacity of Clemson's parking lots.  
It was written using html and javascript, and uses mapbox to display a map of Clemson. Each lot is colored on the map to indicate how full it is. Hovering over a lot displays information about it. The website calls the API on a timer to get updated data.
